    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Murgh Kari makes use of a potent spice blend that includes garam masala,
      coriander, turmeric, and cayenne pepper. Tomato, yogurt, and onion are
      also essential ingredients in this classic Indian main dish. Fresh minced
      garlic and ginger lend a pleasant sharpness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our top-rated recipe uses skinless, boneless chicken breasts for a tender,
      evenly cooked result, but other cuts like tenderloin and thigh make
      suitable substitutions.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ cup cooking oil</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>½ tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 cups plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>1 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoons garam masala</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken
        in the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides.
        Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil
        remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and
        translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric,
        coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture;
        allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring. Add tomatoes,
        yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to the
        mixture; stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate.
        Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat
        with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the
        chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in
        the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F
        (74 degrees C). Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
